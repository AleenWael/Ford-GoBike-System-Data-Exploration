# Ford GoBike System Dataset
## by Aleen AlSuhaibani


## Dataset

> Ford GoBike System Lately known as "Bay Wheels" is 'the first regional and large-scale bicycle sharing system deployed in California and on the West Coast of the United States. It was established as Bay Area Bike Share in August 2013. As of January 2018, the Bay Wheels system had over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. <sup>1</sup> <br> In this project I will be exploring the dataset of Ford GoBike that was collected in February and March of 2019. I will start with data wrangling followed by visualizations of univariate, bivariate, and lastly multivariate explorations.<br>

## Summary of Findings

<ul>
    <li> Males proportion is higher than females in the dataset.
    <li> Most bikers use the bikes for less than 25 minutes.
    <li> The most common station is Market St Station followed by San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 and the third most common station is Berry St Station
    <li> The members are using the bikes for less than hour, and most commonly at 5pm - 6pm, and 8 am, which implies that they are mostly using it to commute to/from work.
    <li> Most of the members are under 40 years old.
    <li> There are a huge difference between bike shareable trips and non-shareable trips, as over 140,000 are not bike shared.
    <li> There is a clear distinguished difference between Subscribers and Customers as the subscribers portion is higher than the customers
    <li> People tend to use the bikes more on the weekdays than weekends.
    <li> Most young people from 20-40 are using the bikes in the period of between 7-9 AM and from 5-8 PM mostly, which is obvious because it is associated with the rush hours of going to/from work or university.
    <li> Young people from 20-40 tend to take longer rides than older people.
    <li> Females tend to take longer rides in comparison with males.
    <li> Customers have longer trip durations in comparison with subscribers, for an average of approximately 20 minutes for Customers and an average of 10 minutes for Subscribers.
    <li> People tend to take long rides in the weekend when compared to weekdays. Weekend rides have an average of 14 minutes while Weekdays are about 11 minutes average.
    <li> There is no clear difference between the starting hour of trips in the weekend or weekdays, but it appears that the average starting hour is around 1 PM.
    <li> The median of the starting hours for week days starting from Monday-Thursday appears to be the same which equals to 2-3 pm, while the median drops significantly on Friday and equals to 12 pm, and on weekends equals to 3 pm.
    <li> Even though the proportion of males and females in the dataset are different, the visualizations showed similar peaks between males and females starting hour, which have a peak between 8-9 am.
    <li> Female customers and subscribers tend to take long rides in comparison with male customers and subscribers.
    <li> We observed a significant difference between Customers and Subcribers, subscribers usage for bicycles tends to follow a steady pattern on weekdays and having a slight peak on weekends. On the other hand, customer usage appears to be unpredictable on weekdays in comparison to the weekends having a high peak that average trips could take about 27 minutes long.
    <li> Females and males tend to take longer rides in the weekend especially Sunday for females and Saturday for males.
</ul>

## Key Insights for Presentation

> I will show in the presentation the visualizations that have a clear insights such as: <br>
 - Top 10 Common Station Visualization. <br>
 - Starting & Ending Hours Distribution. <br>
 - Distribution of Members' Age vs Trip Duration. <br>
 - Distribution of Trip days based on User Type and Avg. Duration. <br>
